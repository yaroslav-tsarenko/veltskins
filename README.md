# Veltskins

Storefront and admin for Veltskins (veltskins.com), a Counter-Strike 2 skins store built with Next.js 16. The store sells weapon skins, knives and gloves it sources from an item supplier and delivers each item to the buyer's Steam account as a trade offer. It is a store, not a marketplace: customers cannot sell or list items.

## Tech stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM 7 (`@prisma/adapter-pg`)
- JWT session cookie plus Steam OpenID sign-in and account linking
- Card payments behind a provider interface (`src/lib/payments`); no live provider connected yet
- Item supplier: api.sih.market (catalogue, live price, purchase and delivery)
- next-intl (messages in `messages/en/*.json`), Nodemailer, pdf-lib invoices

## How it works

### Catalogue

`src/lib/sih/sync.ts` pulls the supplier catalogue, parses each `market_hash_name` (`src/lib/sih/parse.ts`) and builds one storefront product per unique market hash name, which already encodes weapon, finish, exterior and StatTrak/Souvenir. When the supplier has several offers for the same name, the cheapest in-stock offer is kept (lowest float on a price tie) and its details are stored server-side only in `SihItem.offer`.

`src/lib/sih/catalog-select.ts` then picks a balanced set across weapon types, weapons, rarities, exteriors and price bands. Caps, price limits, margin defaults and price bands live in `src/config/catalog.ts`. Products already listed are preferred on re-sync, and every write is an upsert keyed by the market hash name (deterministic product ids), so re-running the sync never duplicates products. Items that drop out are archived, never deleted.

Data model: `Product` (storefront) ↔ `Skin` (public filter attributes: weapon type, weapon, rarity, exterior, float range, StatTrak, Souvenir, collection, phase) ↔ `SihItem` (supplier cost, stock and offer metadata). Categories are weapon type → weapon.

### Steam

- `/api/auth/steam` starts Steam OpenID sign-in or, with `link=1`, links Steam to the signed-in account. Return URLs always use `APP_URL`.
- `/account/steam` saves the trade URL; it is accepted only when its partner id matches the linked SteamID64.
- Checkout requires a linked Steam account with a saved trade URL.

### Money flow

1. `POST /api/checkout` re-confirms each item's live supplier price. If a price rose beyond `SIH_PRICE_TOLERANCE`, the product is re-priced and the buyer sees the new total before paying (`TOTAL_CHANGED`).
2. One `Order` is created with one `OrderItem` and one `SihOrder` (status `awaiting_payment`) per skin, plus the buyer's consent to immediate delivery (timestamp, text and version).
3. The configured payment provider creates a payment for the exact charge total and the buyer is redirected to its payment page. The provider reference is stored as `Order.paymentId`.
4. `POST /api/webhooks/payment/<provider>` verifies the webhook, re-fetches the payment state from the provider and passes that verified state to `settlePayment` (`src/lib/payment-settlement.ts`). Settlement checks the amount and currency for an exact match (anything else is held for review with a critical alert), claims the order as paid once, emails the confirmation and invoice, and submits each `SihOrder` to the supplier with a single-flight `paid → submitted` claim. Supplier failures park the item as `refund_pending` and raise a critical alert.
5. `POST /api/webhooks/sih?secret=…` re-fetches the authoritative supplier state and moves items through `processing → sent → finished`, or `failed`/`rolled_back` → `refund_pending`.
6. Refunds are operator-driven: `/admin/sih` lists the refund backlog with "Mark refunded".

A bag can hold several skins; they are paid together and delivered item by item. Each item's status is visible on `/account/orders/[id]`, which also triggers a rate-limited refresh from the supplier while items are in flight.

### Payments

No card provider is connected yet. Everything provider-specific sits behind one interface in `src/lib/payments/provider.ts`:

| Method | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `createPayment({ order, amount, currency, returnUrl, cancelUrl, webhookUrl, customer })` | Creates the payment and returns `{ redirectUrl, providerRef }`. |
| `parseWebhook(request)` | Verifies the signature and returns `{ providerRef, orderId, status, amount, currency }`, with `status` one of `paid`, `failed`, `pending`. Throws `PaymentWebhookError` to reject. |
| `fetchStatus(providerRef)` | Returns the same shape straight from the provider's API. |

`PAYMENT_PROVIDER` selects the provider:

- `none` (default) — `available` is false. `POST /api/checkout` answers `503 { "code": "PAYMENTS_NOT_CONNECTED" }` before touching the supplier or creating an order, and checkout shows "Card payments are being connected. Nothing has been charged."
- `mock` — local testing. Allowed only when `NODE_ENV` is not `production` and `PAYMENT_MOCK_ENABLED=true`; otherwise env validation fails and `src/instrumentation.ts` stops the server at startup. Checkout redirects to `/checkout/mock-pay` (404 in production), whose Pay / Fail buttons record the outcome and send an HMAC-signed webhook to `/api/webhooks/payment/mock`, so the whole paid → supplier → delivered path can be run against the supplier mock.

The webhook route never settles from the payload alone: it always calls `fetchStatus` and settles from that answer. Settlement is idempotent, so repeated or late webhooks are safe.

To connect a real provider:

1. Add `src/lib/payments/<name>.ts` exporting a `PaymentProvider` with `id: "<name>"`. `createPayment` must charge exactly `amount` in `currency` and use `order.id` as the provider's merchant reference; `fetchStatus` must return the amount and currency the provider actually captured, or settlement holds the order for review.
2. Add its variables to `src/lib/env.ts` (validated with zod like the others) and to `.env.example`.
3. Add `"<name>"` to `PAYMENT_PROVIDER_IDS` in `src/lib/env.ts` and register the provider in the `PROVIDERS` map in `src/lib/payments/provider.ts`.
4. Set `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=<name>` and register `https://<your-domain>/api/webhooks/payment/<name>` with the provider if it does not take a per-payment webhook URL.

### Crons

`vercel.json` runs four daily jobs (Vercel Hobby allows daily schedules only): catalogue sync, in-flight order poll, deep reconcile, and balance/stuck-order monitor. Webhooks remain the primary path; the daily poll and the on-view refresh are backstops. On a plan that allows it, change the poll schedule to every few minutes. All cron routes require `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`.

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # fill in values, at least JWT_SECRET
npm run local:setup         # creates the veltskins database, pushes the schema, seeds, syncs the catalogue
npm run dev
```

`local:setup` needs a local PostgreSQL. It writes `DATABASE_URL`/`DIRECT_URL` into `.env` if they are empty (override the server with `LOCAL_PG_URL`). The catalogue sync runs against the live supplier when `SIH_API_KEY` is set, or against a JSON file in the supplier's `get-items` shape when `SIH_FIXTURE_FILE` is set.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Local dev server |
| `npm run build` | `prisma generate` + production build |
| `npm run local:setup` | Local database, schema, seed and first catalogue sync |
| `npm run catalog:sync` | Sync the catalogue now (`-- --fixture <file>` to use a local file) |
| `npm run sih:smoke` | Read-only supplier check: auth, balance, catalogue, one live price. Buys nothing |
| `npm run sih:webhook` | Register the supplier webhook at `$APP_URL/api/webhooks/sih?secret=…` (`-- clear` removes it) |

## Configuration

- `src/config/catalog.ts` — catalogue quotas per weapon type, price limits, margin defaults, price bands.
- `src/config/store-policy.ts` — currencies, delivery wording, refund timeframes, order limits, the withdrawal waiver text. Policy pages, FAQ, emails and checkout read from here.
- `src/lib/company.ts` — company particulars (placeholders until provided).
- `.env.example` — every environment variable, grouped by service.

## Deployment

Deploy on Vercel with the variables from `.env.example`. Set `APP_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the main domain; the `*.vercel.app` address should redirect there so Steam sign-in, payment returns and payment webhooks never use the technical URL. After the first deploy run `npm run sih:webhook` once with production variables.
