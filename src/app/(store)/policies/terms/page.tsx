          These terms apply to every order placed on {F.domain}. {F.brand} is a trading name of {F.company}. When these terms say
          “we”, “us” or “our”, they mean {F.company}. “You” means the person placing the order.

          We sell to consumers buying items for their own Steam account. {F.brand} is a store: we sell items we source, and you cannot sell,

          We sell cosmetic items for {F.game}: weapon finishes (skins), knives and gloves. Items are digital. They are delivered to your
          Steam account, they change only how weapons look in the game and they have no effect on gameplay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each listing is one item with a stated market name, rarity, exterior and quality (normal, StatTrak&trade; or Souvenir). Where an
          exterior applies, we show the float range that exterior allows for that finish. The exact float value, pattern and any phase
          not stated on the listing are those of the item delivered and are shown in Steam after delivery. Images are the standard Steam
          images for the item.
        </p>
        <p>
          Items exist inside Steam, a service run by Valve Corporation. {F.brand} is not affiliated with or endorsed by Valve. Steam’s
          own terms, including the Steam Subscriber Agreement, apply to your Steam account and to items in it. Valve can change how items
          work, how they can be traded or whether they remain available in the game.

          Each listing is a single item, so you can buy each item once per order, and up to {F.maxItemsPerOrder} items in one order. We may
          decline an order before the contract is formed, or cancel it afterwards with a full refund, if an item is no longer available,
          if the price or description shown was clearly wrong, if your Steam account cannot receive trade offers, if the order is linked
          to a restricted country or territory, or if the payment appears fraudulent. We tell you by email if this happens.

          Directive in the EU, you normally have {F.withdrawalDays} days to cancel a contract for digital content. That right ends
          once delivery of the digital content has begun with your express consent and your acknowledgement that you lose the right.

          At checkout there is a separate box, which is not ticked in advance: “{F.waiverText}” You cannot place an order without
          ticking it. We record the time you ticked it and the wording you agreed to, and we repeat it in your order confirmation email.
          Delivery begins when we send the trade offer for your item, which happens straight after your payment is confirmed.
