          The Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 (UK) and the Consumer Rights Directive (EU) give consumers {F.withdrawalDays} days to
          cancel a contract for digital content, unless delivery has begun with their express consent and acknowledgement that the
          right is lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our items are delivered straight after payment. At checkout you tick a separate box, which is not ticked in advance: “
          {F.waiverText}” Without it the order cannot be placed. We store the time and the wording with your order and repeat it in your
          confirmation email.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delivery begins when we send the Steam trade offer for an item. Until then you can cancel without charge: email {F.email} or use
          the <Link href="/contact">contact form</Link> with your order number.

          <li>The trade offer failed or expired before you could accept it, for a reason on our side.</li>
          <li>Steam reversed the trade while the item was under trade protection and the item left your inventory.</li>

          If an offer cannot be completed because of the receiving Steam account, for example an invalid trade URL, a private inventory, a
          trade ban or cooldown, or a Steam Guard restriction, we refund the item and tell you what to change before buying again.

          Once an item is in your Steam inventory and the trade is not reversed by Steam, we do not take it back or refund it because you
          changed your mind, found a lower price elsewhere, or wanted a different float or pattern within the stated range.

          Changes Valve makes to {F.game} or to Steam, such as changes to how an item looks or to trading rules, are outside our control and

          We refund within {F.refundDays} days of the day we confirm the refund to you. The money goes to {F.refundMethod}, in the currency you
          paid in. Where an order had several items, we refund only the items affected. We do not charge a fee for refunds. Your bank may take
          a few further working days to show it on your statement.

        <p>
          Each item on your <Link href="/account/orders">order page</Link> shows its status, including “Refund pending” and
          “Refunded”. We also email you when a refund is issued.
